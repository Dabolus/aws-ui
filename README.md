LocalUI is a simple web portal that uses the AWS SDK (v3) to interact with AWS
services. It is designed to be used with emulated AWS services (LocalStack,
Minio, etc.), even though it can technically be used also with real AWS
services.

## Features

- Interact with different emulators on different ports with the same UI
  (even for multiple emulators of the same service!)
- Quickly perform tasks that are common in development environments with ease
  (e.g. delete multiple S3 buckets at once, quickly preview S3 files, etc.)
